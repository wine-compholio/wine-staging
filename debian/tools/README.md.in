What is Wine-Compholio?
=======================

The **Wine "Compholio" Edition** is a special patched version of Wine that
includes both patches written by our team directly and specific patches by
third party developers that we consider good enough for inclusion.  This can
be seen as a testing version in preparation for patches to be submitted
to upstream Wine - don't be surprised if you encounter additional bugs,
which are not present in regular wine, and always report such issues to us
(via github), so we can improve our fixes even further. Thanks!

How to install Wine-Compholio
=============================

Ready-to-use packages for Wine-Compholio are available for a variety
of different Linux distributions directly for download. Just follow the
instructions below to install it (and all required dependencies). After the
installation, please take a look at the next section for instructions how
to use it in order to run your desired application.

**Important:** If you already have installed 'pipelight' on your system, there
is a good chance that you already have Wine-Compholio. Take a look at the
next section on how to find out if this is the case.

If your distribution is not listed below, feel free to add a feature request -
if the demand is high enough we might consider packaging it for additional
distributions.

```


![alt text](http://repos.fds-team.de/misc/images/opensuse.png) OpenSUSE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

All the following steps have to be executed as root user. As a first step
you have to add the repository - this step depends on the openSUSE version
you're using.

| openSUSE version    | Path component          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| openSUSE 12.2       | `/openSUSE_12.2/`       |
| openSUSE 12.3       | `/openSUSE_12.3/`       |
| openSUSE 13.1       | `/openSUSE_13.1/`       |
| openSUSE Factory    | `/openSUSE_Factory/`    |
| openSUSE Tumbleweed | `/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/` |

The following commandline is an example for openSUSE 13.1, for a different
version just replace the path component according to the table above:
```bash
zypper ar --refresh http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/DarkPlayer:/Pipelight/openSUSE_13.1/home:DarkPlayer:Pipelight.repo
```

Afterwards just run the following commands to install it:
```bash
zypper ref
zypper install wine-compholio
```


![alt text](http://repos.fds-team.de/misc/images/fedora.png) Fedora
-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Warning:** In contrary to other distributions, its not possible to have both
a regular wine version and Wine-Compholio installed at the same time - using
the instructions below will replace your regular version. Moreover it will
be installed to `/usr/bin/wine` in contrary to `/opt/wine-compholio/bin/wine`.

As a first step you have to add the repository - this step depends on the
Fedora version you're using.

| Fedora version  | Patch component |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Fedora 18       | `/Fedora_18/`   |
| Fedora 19       | `/Fedora_19/`   |
| Fedora 20       | `/Fedora_20/`   |

The following commandline is an example for Fedora 19, for a different version
just replace the path component according to the table above:
```bash
sudo wget http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/DarkPlayer:/Pipelight/Fedora_19/home:DarkPlayer:Pipelight.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/pipelight.repo
```

Afterwards run the following command to install the package:
```bash
sudo yum install wine-compholio
```

Please note that you might run into trouble if the official Fedora package
(without compholio patches) is newer than the one from the repository above,
so if something doesn't work, always make sure that you have installed
our version. To do that just run:
```bash
/usr/bin/wine --patches
```

When you're using Wine-Compholio this will show to a list of all patches
included, for an unpatched version this command will fail.


![alt text](http://repos.fds-team.de/misc/images/mageia.png) Mageia 4
---------------------------------------------------------------------

As a first step please add the key for our repository
```bash
wget http://repos.fds-team.de/Release.key
rpm --import Release.key
```

If you're using a 32-bit version of Mageia just add the repository
for 32-bit packages:
```bash
sudo urpmi.addmedia "Compholio 32-bit" http://cdn.fds-team.de/stable/mageia/4/i586/
```

For a 64-bit version of Mageia you'll need both the 32-bit and the
64-bit repository:
```bash
sudo urpmi.addmedia "Compholio 32-bit" http://cdn.fds-team.de/stable/mageia/4/i586/
sudo urpmi.addmedia "Compholio 64-bit" http://cdn.fds-team.de/stable/mageia/4/x86_64/
```

Afterwards run the following commands to install the package:
```bash
sudo urpmi.update -a
sudo urpmi wine-compholio
```

Using Wine-Compholio
====================

Since we don't want to duplicate a lot of information here, we recommend
to take a look at the [official Wine FAQ](http://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ) for
general information about how to use Wine. The following part will mainly
concentrate on the differences between wine and Wine-Compholio.


Running Wine-Compholio
----------------------

**Using multiple Wine versions:** Unless you specify a special `WINEPREFIX`
environment variable, Wine-Compholio will use the same wineprefix `~/.wine`
(in your home directory) like regular wine. This allows you to use your
already installed programs directly, without much effort or reinstalling
them. Often you have both regular wine and Wine-Compholio installed at the
same time, which is *absolutely no problem* - by typing in either `wine`
(=regular wine) or `/opt/wine-compholio/bin/wine` you can decide, which
wine version you want to run. You can switch between versions as often as
you like - just make sure that all Windows programs have terminated before
starting them with a different version.

To run Wine-Compholio always type `/opt/wine-compholio/bin/wine`, for example:
```bash
cd ~/.wine/drive_c/<your path>/
/opt/wine-compholio/bin/wine game.exe
```

You also have to add `/opt/wine-compholio/bin/` when running other wine
related programs, here are some additional example:
```bash
# Initialize the wine prefix
/opt/wine-compholio/bin/wineboot

# Open the wine configuration
/opt/wine-compholio/bin/winecfg

# Run winepath to convert paths
/opt/wine-compholio/bin/winepath --unix 'c:\Windows'

# Kill the running wineserver instance
/opt/wine-compholio/bin/wineserver -k

...
```

If you're an experienced user, and always want to use Wine-Compholio, you
can also add `/opt/wine-compholio/bin` to your bash profile. We will not
go into detail here, because such a setup has the big disadvantage, that
it hides which version you're using - which is very important for getting
support or reporting bugs.


Submitting bugs
---------------

**Warning: Do not submit bug reports at bugs.winehq.org when using this
version!**

If you encounter any issues, the first thing you should do is to try it with
regular wine.  We're only a very small developer team, and although we would
like to do that, we probably cannot really solve all your Wine bugs. When
it turns out that the official Wine version also doesn't work, you can file
a bugreport at the official [Wine bugtracker](http://bugs.winehq.org/).
Feel free to mention that you also tested with Wine-Compholio, but all
bugreport related information (logs, crashdumps, ...) should concentrate
only on upstream wine.

If it turns out, that it works with upstream wine, but not with Wine-Compholio,
then it might be a regression caused by our patches. We would like you to
report this issue to us, so we can fix it in future versions. You can also
report issues, when testing with upstream Wine is impossible or it crashes
with a different error (for example much earlier).

When submitting a application related bug here on github, please make sure to
include at least the following information. Generally its always a good idea
to provide as much information as possible, since this will significantly
increase chances to provide support and to fix it.

1. **Which application triggers the bug**
    * Application name and version number
    * How to obtain it (download URL + checksum if public available)

2. **What exactly doesn't work**
    * Log of the terminal output of the application
    * For visual issues please additionally attach a screenshot, and describe
      what it should look like
    * *Optionally:* If you already know whats going wrong, please attach
      appropriate `WINEDEBUG` logs or excerpts showing the issue.

3. **Details about your WINEPREFIX**
    * *Recommended:* Test it in a new wine prefix, and report if this works
    * Did you install any overrides? (for examples by using `winetricks`)
    * Did you change any settings by running `winecfg`?

4. **Information about your Wine-Compholio version**
    * *Recommended:* Test with regular wine, and report if this works
    * Version number (`/opt/wine-compholio/bin/wine --version`)
    * Patches in your build (`/opt/wine-compholio/bin/wine --patches`)
    * Installed optional libraries (`/opt/wine-compholio/bin/wine --check-libs`)
