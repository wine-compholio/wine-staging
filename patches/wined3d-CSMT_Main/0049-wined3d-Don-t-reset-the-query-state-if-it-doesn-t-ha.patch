Subject: wined3d: Don't reset the query state if it doesn't have a ctx

The CS recreates occlusion queries and changes the context variable.
This leads to incorrect query results.

TODO: Before sending, find out why the line was there in the first place
and if it is needed with the multithreaded and/or singlethreaded CS.
